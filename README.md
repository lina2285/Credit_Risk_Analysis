# Credit_Risk_Analysis

##Overview

The purpose of this analysis is to gauge credit risk through building a supervised machine learning model to help Jill have a more clear understanding of risk before meeting with potential investors. In this model the loan status is being analyzed as "high-sisk" or "low-risk" classes. Unfortunatelly, these classes are not balanced as the low risk loans outnumber the high-risk loans, consequently, we are using the imbalanced-learn library. For this we used RandomOverSample and SMOTE, ClusterCentroids, SMOTEENN, BlancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEsembleClassifier.
